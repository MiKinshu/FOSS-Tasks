Wings I will join

Since I have little to no idea of my potencial in any wing that our college ,I have figured out that best way to explore is to try out all the wings that are there adn see where I am most interested in

1) WebDev - Right now the most easy wing that I think I can join and explore
2) SoftwareDev - Relatively easy task of completeing python tutorial playlist on youtube so I think I can go with it also
3) FOSS- Obviously the most popular wing and I think the most basic requirement of working in a project in konowing how to operate on github and thats why I will complete may projects of this wing.
4) AI wing - A relatively tougher task of completing Coursera lecture so finger crossed about how I will be able to continue in it
