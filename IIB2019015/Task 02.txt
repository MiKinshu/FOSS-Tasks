Actually I am completely confused about which wings I like.
But as of now I came to know that python is being taught in Softdev so I started following that channel.
But as 2 to 3 days passed ,I started feeling that I should follow more than one channel,
So , as of now I am following Softdev and FOSS and both of them seems quite interesting:).
